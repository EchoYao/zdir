## About Zdir

Zdir is a multifunctional private storage program developed with Golang + Vue3, integrating file indexing, online preview, and sharing capabilities. It supports WebDAV and Cloud download, making it an ideal choice for installation on NAS devices or large-capacity VPS, suitable for individuals, studios, and small teams to share files.

## Origin

### 2018

Many years ago, the company's operations and maintenance department used nginx to build a file indexing platform for sharing common software for employees to download. However, nginx's indexing capabilities were extremely limited, with a simple interface and single functionality. As a VPS enthusiast who likes to tinker, I, xiaoz, conceived the idea of building my own file-sharing platform. After trying solutions like Fancy Index, PHP Directory Lister, and h5ai, I was still not satisfied. Finally, in 2018, I officially developed Zdir `1.x` with PHP.

> In 2021, the `2.x.x` version officially ended its lifecycle, and since then, we no longer maintain the PHP version of Zdir!

### 2022

Over time, the problems of the `2.x.x` version became increasingly apparent, and the limitations of PHP made it difficult to resolve. Therefore, in 2022, I fully reconstructed it with new technologies Golang and Vue3, releasing a brand-new `3.x.x` version.

### 2024

Today, we proudly announce the arrival of Zdir version `4.x`. `4.x` has been upgraded and optimized based on the `3.x.x` version, with a redesigned front-end interface. We invite you to install and experience it.

> Starting from version 4.x, we will no longer open source. The previous source code can still be found on Github: [https://github.com/helloxz/zdir](https://github.com/helloxz/zdir)
